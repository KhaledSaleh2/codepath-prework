## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Apps I enjoy:

Apple Music

- Super easy to access recently downloaded songs

- I like being able to shuffle all my saved music without having to make a playlist

Apple Maps

- Gives accurate traffic updates and arrival times

- The layout is clean and simple which makes it easy to follow while walking or driving

Venmo

- Makes it really quick to send or request money from people

- I like how you can leave notes or emojis which makes it feel more casual

Notion

- I use it to keep track of everything from to-do lists to class notes

- You can customize it however you want which makes it super flexible
- 

I’d like to build an app for college students that lets them upload their class schedules and easily compare them with their friends. It would be limited to users with a .edu email so it stays within the student community. The main features would be adding friends, viewing shared free time, and seeing which classes overlap. I also want to include a section for each class where users can post questions, study tips, or shared resources. It’s meant to make planning more social and help students stay connected.

## Notes

The hardest part of this project for me was figuring out how to use Xcode. There were a few buttons that took me longer than it should've to find. This was the majority of the challenge I had with this project.
